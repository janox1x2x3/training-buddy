    <string name="aboutString">Training buddy transfers your smartphone into training diary, which stores
        sport activities and provides you advanced review, on what have you been training. 
        Purpose of creating this application is to let you store all kinds of sport activities at one place. 
        As professional canoe-slalom paddler I was not able to find application, that can store all power, endurance and other 
        specific activities in it. </string>
    <string name="aboutString2">Application is still in development, so I would be more than pleased if you email me with your
        opinions, improvements or bugs that you have found, so we can make this application better together.</string>
    <string name="updateSync">Be not afraid of reinstalling application or switching your smartphone. Register, synchronize and store your activities safely on internet. 
        EXISTING USERS - just register new account, you will not loose your already stored data!!! </string>
